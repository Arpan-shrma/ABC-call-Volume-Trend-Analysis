# Project Description:-

ABC call Volume Trend Analysis project is about finding trends and insights about the dataset of Inbound calls of a ABC company from the insurance category. In this project, I have used the Call_Volume_Trend_Analysis provided by trainity and drawn some conclusions. I have provided insights to topics and answered the questions asked by the management team. I have used Google Spreadsheets and Microsoft Excel for data analytics and data visualisation.

# Approach:- 
Firstly, I have used the basics of the data analytics process to clean the raw data and ask questions from cleaned data. Then, I have used data wrangling to make small data frames for relevant insights to answer all the possible questions. Finally, I combined all the results into an interactive visual dashboard using excel(Glimpse shown below).
